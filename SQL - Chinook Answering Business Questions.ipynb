    "- Albums from Meteor and the Girls, Red Tone, and Slim Jim Bites should yield the most sales from the newly signed record label.\n",
    "- The differences in sales across each agents is roughly explained by their hiring dates.\n",
    "- USA has generated the most sales over time.\n",
    "- Countries in 'Other' category should be noted as they make up a significant amount after addition.\n",
    "- Growth shown in countries with high cus_order_lifetime (high spend), and low total_customers.\n",
    "- It is not advisable for management to switch their purchasing strategy to only acquire the most popular track, as 57% of invoices are album purchases"
